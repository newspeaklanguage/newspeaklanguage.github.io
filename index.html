        <h3>What is Newspeak?</h3>



<p>Newspeak is an object-capability
	programming platform that lets you develop code in your web
	browser.
	The entire Newspeak IDE runs locally in the browser. It will run on
	desktop, tablet or phone. <a href =
	"https://newspeaklanguage.org/webIDE/">Try
	it online right now</a>.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://selflanguage.org/">Self</a>, Newspeak is
	message-based; all names are dynamically bound. However, like
	Smalltalk, Newspeak uses classes rather than prototypes. As in
	Beta, classes may nest. Because class names are late bound,
	all classes are virtual, every class can act as a mixin, and
	class hierarchy inheritance falls out automatically. Top level
	classes are essentially self contained parametric namespaces,
	and serve to define component style modules, which naturally
	define sandboxes in an object-capability style. Newspeak was
	deliberately designed as a principled dynamically typed
	language. We plan to evolve the language to support <a
	href="http://bracha.org/pluggableTypesPosition.pdf">pluggable
	types</a>.
        Last but not least, Newspeak is a reflective, live system (if
	you don't know what a live programming system is, see <a href
	= "https://youtu.be/VUfZ1sL4aps">this 5
	minute video</a>).
	</p>

	<h3>The Newspeak Vision</h3>

	<p> Applications should work well
	both on or off-line, combining the ease of maintenance of web
	applications with the high quality user experience of local
	clients. See <a
	href="http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2007/03/sobs.html">the Room
	101 blog</a> for details.
	</p>

	<p>Applications should be a joy to write and to read.
	 The best way to create such applications is to create
	 interactive narratives via live, literate programming. We want an editor for interactive narratives.</p>
	
<p>Such an editor should be scriptable. You should be able to write
	programs that control the editor in a powerful, general
	purpose programming language (Newspeak). In fact, every last bit of functionality the editor provides should be accessible programmatically.</p>

<p>Said editor should, of course, support its scripting language. Support means more than pretty-printing or syntax highlighting. It means you can evaluate the code.  In particular, you can evaluate code that affects what the editor does.</p>

<p>Being a modern editor, you can build documents that contain more than just text. You can embed images, audio, video. In fact, you should be able to embed arbitrary widgets. So you might evaluate code that creates a UI element and inserts into the editor.  Now you can make the editor modify its own GUI. In fact, the editor can be extended into a general purpose GUI builder. And every such GUI can modify itself if you wish; sometimes you may wish to modify it so it can no longer modify itself, and then you have a frozen application. Your editor has become an IDE. In fact, it is a live literate programming environment.</p>

<p>If the editor’s scripting language interoperates well with the surrounding environment, it can be used to control the computer and everything the computer itself controls. You can check in to the environment and hardly ever leave. You can lead your cyber life in it.</p>

<p>Now, imagine that the code you created in this environment was modular and secure.
Imagine the editor’s scripting language can deploy the same code on web, desktop or mobile. Imagine that the applications built with the language support online and offline use out of the box, automatically synchronizing data and code between clients and servers. Imagine that they have built-in support for collaboration, either syncing in real time or merging offline as required.</p>

<p>
This is what Newspeak is supposed to provide. We're not there yet, but
we have an elegant foundation to get us there. If this vision excites
you, we welcome volunteers to make it happen sooner.
</p>


        <h3>Status</h3>

<p>The current version of Newspeak runs on top of WASM, and has been tested
on Safari, Firefox and Chrome-based browsers, both desktop and
mobile. You can try it out <a href = "https://newspeaklanguage.org/webIDE/">here</a>.  The IDE is a progressive web app,
	which means it can be installed locally on your machine and
	function like a normal app, with no internet connection. The latest development version is available at <a href="https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak">our source code repository</a>.</p>

<p>The WASM based version is still a work in progress. We no longer support the old Squeak Smalltalk based
implementation.</p>

<h3>Who’s to blame for Newspeak?</h3>

<p> Newspeak was created by
<a href="http://bracha.org/">Gilad Bracha</a>, Peter Ahe, <a
href="http://blog.3plus4.org/">Vassili Bykov</a>, Ryan Macnak, <a
href="http://www.mirandabanda.org/cogblog/about-cog/">Eliot
Miranda</a> and Bill Maddox with invaluable contributions, both
technical and otherwise, by Yaron Kashai. </p>

<h3>Why is it called Newspeak?</h3>

<p>In Orwell's novel 1984, Newspeak was a language that grew smaller over time. Unlike the case of natural languages, for a programming language this is actually a good thing. It is an ideal we strive for - a shrinkable language. </p>
